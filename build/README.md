# Build Resources

This directory contains build resources for the Electron application.

## Icon Files

To customize the application icon, place the following files in this directory:

- `icon.png` - A 512x512 PNG icon for the application
- `icon.ico` - A Windows ICO file (can be generated from icon.png)

You can use online tools like https://icoconvert.com/ to convert PNG to ICO format.

The default icon is loaded from the URL specified in the manifest.json file.
